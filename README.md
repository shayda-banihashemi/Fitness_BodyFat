**Created By:** Shayda Banihashemi

**About this project:**

This notebook uses a body measurement dataset to analyze fitness and body fat. Various
technologies are used to visualize the findings such as seaborn and numpy scatterplots.
Predictions are made using linear regression.

**Why the project is useful:**

This project uses linear regression as well as feature selection techniques to
identify body fat predictors. 

**What is the status of this project**

This project is ongoing with the first phase cleaning and determining the shape of the 
data. The relationship between age and body fat was analyzed as well as bodyfat and
multiple body measurements. Linear regression and feature selection were leveraged
to determine body fat predictors.
